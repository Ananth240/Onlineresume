        <p>During my internship at PwC, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects and tasks, starting with visiting a client and preparing information for a proposal with a tight deadline. From the outset, I demonstrated a strong work ethic and attention to detail, which earned praise from both the client and my manager/ director.</p>
        <p>As I progressed through my internship, I worked on completing audits with different seniors and gained the trust of my managers, who began assigning me more complex tasks. In particular, I excelled at performing reviews of financial statements, where I identified important areas for improvement that impressed the director on the engagements.</p>
        <p>As a result of my performance, I was entrusted with key tasks that were typically assigned to more experienced team members, such as fixing cashflow statements and reviewing work papers prior to sign-off. My initiative and strong work ethic were recognized by my colleagues in the office, and I gained a reputation for consistently delivering high-quality work.</p>
        <p>In my second term of the internship, I was given important responsibilities such as identifying quality checks in accordance with PwC's methodology and field work in significant areas under the supervision of the senior in-charge. Overall, my internship at PwC has been a challenging and rewarding experience that has enabled me to develop my skills and gain valuable insights into the world of auditing.</p>
